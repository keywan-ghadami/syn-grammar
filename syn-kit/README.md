# syn-kit

**syn-kit** is the runtime support library for parsers generated by `syn-grammar`. It provides essential utilities for backtracking, error recovery, and testing `syn`-based parsers.

## Features

### 1. Speculative Parsing (Backtracking)
The `attempt` function allows parsers to try a parsing branch and revert the stream cursor if it fails, without consuming tokens. This enables LL(k) lookahead and backtracking logic.

### 2. Intelligent Error Reporting
`syn-kit` implements a "Deepest Error" heuristic. When multiple parsing branches fail, it preserves the error that occurred furthest into the token stream. This prevents generic "unexpected token" errors at the start of a block when a specific syntax error occurred deep inside it.

### 3. Testing Framework
The `testing` module provides a fluent API for unit testing your parsers.
