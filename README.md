# syn-grammar-macros

This crate contains the procedural macros (`grammar!` and `include_grammar!`) used by [syn-grammar](https://crates.io/crates/syn-grammar).

**You likely do not want to use this crate directly.** Instead, add `syn-grammar` to your dependencies, which re-exports these macros.

## Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
syn-grammar = "0.1"
```

See the [main repository](https://github.com/keywan-ghadami/syn-grammar) for documentation and examples.
