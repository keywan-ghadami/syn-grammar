# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.9.0]

### Added
- **Consolidated Error Messages with Labeled Alternatives**: The parser can now produce a single, clear error message when multiple alternatives fail at the same position (e.g., "expected one of: an expression, a statement"). This is enabled by a new labeling mechanism, which uses rule names as default labels and supports explicit labels via the `# "label"` syntax. This replaces ambiguous, single-alternative errors with a helpful summary of all valid possibilities.
- **High-Priority Manual Error Reporting**: Added the `fail("message")` built-in rule, which always fails with a custom error message. Crucially, errors generated by `fail` take precedence over other parsing errors, allowing grammar authors to provide precise, context-aware error messages that are not overridden by the parser's default "expected" messages.
- **Implicit Token Literals and Aliases**: The grammar parser now supports `char` literals (e.g., `'+'`) as a shorthand for single-token string literals. It also includes a prelude of common token aliases (e.g., `PLUS` for `"+"`).
- **Parametric List Rules (ADR 004)**: Added `separated` and `repeated` built-in rules for concise list parsing.
    - `separated(rule, sep, min=0, trailing=false)`: Parses a list of items separated by a delimiter.
    - `repeated(rule, min=0)`: Parses a list of items without a separator.
    - Supports custom container types via generics (e.g., `separated<HashSet>(...)`), defaulting to `Vec`.
- **Named Arguments**: Added support for named arguments in rule calls (e.g., `rule(arg, key=value)`), used by the new list rules.
- **Generic Arguments in Rules**: Added support for generic type arguments in rule calls (e.g., `rule<T>(...)`), enabling the container specification for list rules.
- **Until**: Added support for the `until` pattern (e.g., `body:until(";")`), which consumes tokens until a terminator pattern is found. The terminator is not consumed. This is useful for parsing unstructured content or content with a known delimiter.

### Fixed
- **Built-in Rule Arguments**: Fixed an issue where the validator incorrectly forbade arguments for built-in rules. This allows backend-specific built-ins (or future portable built-ins) to accept arguments as needed.
- **Gap Detection (ADR 005)**: Resolved parsing ambiguity between rule calls with arguments and rule calls followed by a group. The parser is now whitespace-sensitive in this context: `Rule(Arg)` parses as a call with arguments, while `Rule (Group)` (with space) parses as a call followed by a grouped pattern.

## [0.8.0]

### Added
- **Literal Bindings**: Added support for binding string literals directly to variables in grammar rules (e.g., `label:"literal"`). This resolves to the `syn::Token` corresponding to the literal.
- **Optional Literal Bindings**: Added support for optional literal bindings (e.g., `label:"literal"?`), which resolve to `Option<Token>`.
- **Span Binding on Literals**: Extended the span binding syntax (`@`) to support string literals (e.g., `"literal" @ span`), allowing direct capture of a literal's span.

### Breaking Changes
- **Backend API**: The internal data model and macro infrastructure were updated to support the new literal binding features. This constitutes a breaking change for downstream backend implementers (e.g., `winnow-grammar`) who must now handle these new syntax-tree nodes. This change is not breaking for end-users who only write grammars.

## [0.7.1]

### Fixed
- **Typed Parameter Validation**: Fixed a bug where rule parameters with explicit types (e.g., `rule list<T>(item: Type)`) were incorrectly flagged as "Undefined rule" by the validator. The validator now correctly recognizes all parameters, regardless of whether they have explicit types or not.

## [0.7.0]

### Added
- **Portable Primitives**: Introduced a distinction between `PORTABLE_BUILTINS` (`ident`, `integer`, `alpha`, etc.) and `SYN_SPEC_BUILTINS` (`rust_type`, `lit_str`, etc.). This clarifies the portability contract for authors of alternative backends (e.g., `winnow-grammar`), encouraging a rich, shared vocabulary of common parsing concepts.
- **Portable Types**: Introduced backend-agnostic wrapper types `Identifier`, `StringLiteral`, and `SpannedValue<T>`. These types implement `ToTokens`, allowing them to be used seamlessly in `quote! { ... }` macros while provides a consistent API across different backends.
- **Numeric Built-ins**: Added a comprehensive set of portable numeric built-ins:
    - **Signed Integers**: `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, `isize` (and `int*` aliases).
    - **Unsigned Integers**: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `usize` (and `uint*` aliases).
    - **Floating Point**: `f32`, `f64`.
    - **Alternative Bases**: `hex_literal`, `oct_literal`, `bin_literal` (parses into `u64`).
- **Spanned Primitives**: Added `spanned_` variants for all primitives (e.g., `spanned_i32` returns `SpannedValue<i32>`), allowing easy access to source location data.
- **`whitespace` Primitive**: Added the `whitespace` assertion, which ensures a gap (non-adjacency) between two tokens.
- **Lookahead Operators**: Added support for positive (`peek(...)`) and negative (`not(...)`) lookahead operators.
    - `peek(pattern)`: Succeeds if the pattern matches, but does not consume input.
    - `not(pattern)`: Succeeds if the pattern does *not* match. Does not consume input.
- **`alpha` Primitive**: Added the `alpha` built-in primitive, which matches an identifier composed entirely of alphabetic characters.
- **Architecture**: Introduced `Backend` trait and `CommonBuiltins` to decouple the grammar definition from the `syn` implementation, paving the way for other backends.
- **ADR for Primitives**: Added an Architecture Decision Record (`docs/adr/adr1.md`) to document the design for handling character-level, byte-level, and token-level primitives across different backends.
- **ADR for Portable Types**: Added an Architecture Decision Record (`docs/adr/adr2.md`) to document the design for portable types and explicit backend contracts.
- **Higher-Order Generic Rules**: Added support for generic rules with untyped grammar parameters (patterns) and generic type parameters (e.g., `rule list<T>(item) -> Vec<T>`).
- **Monomorphization**: Implemented compile-time monomorphization of generic rules, allowing the creation of reusable grammar patterns without runtime overhead.
- **Generic Arguments in Rules**: Generic parameters now support standard Rust trait bounds, which are enforced on the inferred types.
- **Numeric Argument Support**: Updated the parser to support numeric literals as arguments to rules (e.g., `value(10)`), enabling more flexible rule parameterization.
- **ADR for Generic Rules**: Added an Architecture Decision Record (`docs/adr/adr3.md`) documenting the design of higher-order generic rules and macro-time monomorphization.
- **Restored Tests**: Added back `test_rule_arguments` and `test_multiple_arguments` to ensure rule parameter functionality works as expected.
- **Shadowing Detection**: Compile-time validation now reports errors when a grammar rule alternative is shadowed by a previous prefix alternative or is an exact duplicate.

### Changed
- **Backend-Agnostic Model**: The `syn-grammar-model` crate now exposes `parse_grammar_with_builtins`. This allows backend authors to validate grammars against their own set of built-in rules.
- **Backend Author Guide**: `EXTENDING.md` has been rewritten to focus on how to build custom parser generator backends using `syn-grammar` as the frontend DSL.
- **Validation Errors**: Shadowing and duplicate alternatives are now treated as hard errors instead of warnings to ensure grammar correctness.

### Fixed
- **Repetition Syntax**: Fixed a regression where repetition patterns were incorrectly requiring brackets `[...]` instead of parentheses `(...)`.
- **Linter Warnings**: Resolved multiple `clippy` warnings (unused variables, collapsible if-blocks, approximate constants).
- **Float Testing**: Improved float primitive tests to use proper epsilon comparison for accuracy.

### Breaking Changes
- **Portable Types for Primitives**: To improve backend portability (see ADR 2), several built-in parsers now return backend-agnostic types instead of `syn`-specific ones.
    - `ident` now returns `syn_grammar::Identifier` instead of `syn::Ident`.
    - `string` now returns `syn_grammar::StringLiteral` instead of `String`.
    - **Impact**: Action blocks that expect the previous `syn` types must be updated to use the new portable types (e.g., use `name.text` instead of `name.to_string()` or rely on `Display` impl).
- **Renamed `Spanned<T>` to `SpannedValue<T>`**: The `Spanned<T>` struct has been renamed to `SpannedValue<T>` to avoid name collisions with the `syn::spanned::Spanned` trait.
    - **Impact**: Code that uses `Spanned<T>` (e.g. return types of `spanned_*` built-ins) must be updated to use `SpannedValue<T>`.
- **Built-in Rule Resolution**: The precedence of built-in rules (like `ident`, `string`) has changed. They are no longer hardcoded keywords but are now provided as default implementations in `syn_grammar::builtins`.
    - **Impact**: If you define a rule named `ident` in your grammar, it will now *shadow* the built-in `ident` parser instead of being ignored. This fixes a long-standing limitation but may change behavior if you accidentally relied on the shadowing being ignored.

## [0.6.0]

### Added
- **`use super::*`**: The generated parser module now includes `use super::*;` by default, allowing parsers to seamlessly access other items defined in the parent module.
- **Use Statement Support**: Added support for standard Rust `use` statements within the grammar block (e.g., `use syn::Ident;`). These are passed through to the generated parser module.

## [0.5.0]

### Added
- **Span Binding Syntax**: Added support for the `name:parser @ span_var` syntax. This allows binding the result of a parser to `name` and its span to `span_var` simultaneously (e.g., `id:ident @ span`).

### Deprecated
- **Spanned Literal Parsers**: The `spanned_*_lit` built-in parsers (e.g., `spanned_int_lit`, `spanned_string_lit`) are deprecated. Use the standard literal parsers with the new span binding syntax instead (e.g., `lit_int @ span`).

## [0.4.0]

### Added
- **Token Recognition in Literals**: Enhanced parsing of string literals in the grammar to support multi-token sequences and complex combinations (e.g. `"?."`, `"@detached"`).
- **Pretty Error Printing**: The testing framework now pretty-prints `syn::Error` with source code context and underlining when assertions fail.
- **Outer Attributes**: Added support for parsing outer attributes (`#[...]`) via the `outer_attrs` built-in.
- **Span Binding**: Added support for capturing spans via `rule @ span_var` syntax.

### Improved
- **Error Spans**: Generated code now uses specific token spans instead of `Span::call_site()` where possible, resulting in more precise error highlighting in IDEs.

### Fixed
- **Documentation**: Fixed failing doctests in README, cleaned up examples, and clarified usage of brackets and delimiters.

### Internal
- **Testing**: Stabilized testing infrastructure.

## [0.3.0]

### Breaking Changes
- **Runtime Dependency**: Generated parsers now depend on the new `grammar-kit` crate (formerly `syn-kit`). Users must add `grammar-kit = "0.3.0"` to their `Cargo.toml`.
- **Renamed Built-in Parsers**:
  - `int_lit` has been renamed to **`integer`** (returns `i32`).
  - `string_lit` has been renamed to **`string`** (returns `String`).
  - This change distinguishes high-level value parsers from the low-level token parsers (`lit_int`, `lit_str`).

### Added
- **Attributes on Rules**: Rules can now be decorated with attributes, such as doc comments (`///`) or `#[cfg(...)]`.
- **Error Recovery**: Added `recover(rule, sync_token)` to handle syntax errors gracefully by skipping tokens until a synchronization point.
- **Rule Arguments**: Rules can now accept parameters (e.g., `rule value(arg: i32) -> ...`), allowing context to be passed down the parser chain.
- **Grammar Inheritance**: Grammars can inherit from other modules (e.g., `grammar MyGrammar : BaseGrammar`), enabling the use of external or manually written "custom parsers".
- **Testing Utilities**: Added `syn_grammar::testing` module with fluent assertions (`assert_success_is`, `assert_failure_contains`) to simplify writing tests for grammars.
- **Improved Error Reporting**: The parser now prioritizes "deep" errors (errors that occur after consuming tokens) over shallow errors.
- **New Built-in Parsers**:
  - `lit_int` -> `syn::LitInt`
  - `lit_char` -> `syn::LitChar`
  - `lit_bool` -> `syn::LitBool`
  - `lit_float` -> `syn::LitFloat`
  - `spanned_int_lit` -> `(i32, Span)`
  - `spanned_string_lit` -> `(String, Span)`
  - `spanned_float_lit` -> `(f64, Span)`
  - `spanned_bool_lit` -> `(bool, Span)`
  - `spanned_char_lit` -> `(char, Span)`

### Internal
- **Architecture**: Extracted runtime utilities (backtracking, error reporting, testing) into a separate `grammar-kit` crate.

## [0.2.0]

### Removed
- **`include_grammar!`**: Support for external grammar files (`.g`) has been removed.
  - **Reason**: Error reporting within external files was poor, making debugging difficult.
  - **Migration**: Please move your grammar definitions inline using the `grammar! { ... }` macro to benefit from full Rust compiler diagnostics and IDE support.

### Fixed
- **Generated Code**: Fixed usage of `syn` macros (`bracketed!`, `braced!`, `parenthesized!`) by removing incorrect error propagation (`?`).
- **Generated Code**: Changed rule variant generation to use a flat list of checks instead of `else if` chains, ensuring correct "first match wins" behavior and error fallthrough.

### Internal
- **Architecture**: Extracted grammar parsing, validation, and analysis into a separate `syn-grammar-model` crate. This enables the creation of alternative backends (e.g., `winnow`) in the future.
